**RESPOND IN RUSSIAN** - Comprehensive project-wide analysis:

### SYSTEMATIC CODEBASE SCAN
1. **Security vulnerabilities:**
   - Scan for common security patterns
   - Check dependencies for known vulnerabilities
   - Look for hardcoded secrets, weak authentication
   - SQL injection, XSS, CSRF vulnerabilities
   - Report with file:line:severity format

2. **Critical bugs analysis:**
   - Runtime errors and exception handling
   - Logic errors and edge cases
   - Null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows
   - Race conditions and concurrency issues
   - Report with file:line:impact format

3. **Performance bottlenecks:**
   - Inefficient algorithms (O(nÂ²) where O(n) possible)
   - Memory leaks and excessive allocations
   - Database query optimization opportunities
   - I/O blocking operations
   - CPU-intensive operations in wrong places
   - Report with file:line:impact format

4. **Code quality issues:**
   - Code smells (long methods, god classes)
   - Duplicate code and copy-paste errors
   - Inconsistent naming and styling
   - Missing error handling
   - Outdated comments and documentation
   - Report with file:line:effort format

5. **Architecture problems:**
   - Circular dependencies
   - Tight coupling between modules
   - Missing abstractions
   - Violation of SOLID principles
   - Technical debt accumulation

### IMPACT AND PRIORITY ANALYSIS
For each issue found, provide:
- **Business impact:** Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Technical impact:** Performance/Security/Maintainability
- **Effort to fix:** Small(1-2h)/Medium(1d)/Large(1w+)
- **Dependencies:** What other issues block this
- **Risk level:** If left unfixed

### COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION UPDATE
Update critical_bugs_and_performance_analysis.md with:
- Detailed issue descriptions in Russian
- Priority matrix (impact vs effort)
- Recommended resolution order
- Estimated timeline for fixes
- Risk assessment for each issue

### STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Provide actionable recommendations:
1. Quick wins (high impact, low effort)
2. Critical fixes that should be done immediately
3. Long-term technical debt reduction plan
4. Preventive measures for future development

**Analysis metrics:**
- Total issues found: ___
- Critical: ___ | High: ___ | Medium: ___ | Low: ___
- Estimated total fix time: ___
- Recommended immediate actions: ___
